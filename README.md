This text is an explanation for finishing the game as you may have difficulty in a few rooms.

In some places in the game, dice are thrown. If you cannot get the required dice and you have chosen a difficulty level, your life will decrease by 1 with each try.

It is recommended to avoid selecting a hard level or to choose a low level to finish the game. The enemies are created based on this choice, and the damage they inflict on you may increase accordingly.


First Room (Capsule): You start inside a capsule. The only action you can take is to "go up."

Second Room (Cryonics Capsule Warehouse): You find yourself in a cryonics capsule warehouse. If you try to "go forward," you won't be able to exit because you need a crowbar. To find it, you should "search" the interactive items in the room. You can find the crowbar in "wardrobe2". However, ensure you also collect other necessary items from this room for use in later stages, or else you might have to return here.

Third Room (Corridor): You are in a corridor where you cannot go straight but can move right or left. First, go into the room on the left by using the numbers found in a note from the previous room as a code. Search the items in this room to find an "access_card". Exit back to the corridor and use this card to enter the room on the right. Find another code in this room, then return to the corridor and use this new code to enter the room across from you. The code for this door is your birthday entered at the start of the game. Search this room as well and craft an item using 'craft manager_office_key_part1 manager_office_key_part2' to create the "manager_office_key", which allows you to enter the manager's office.

Manager's Office: Solve the safe's code (which is 123456) in the manager's office. Then, use the "small_gun_part" and "cable" you found to craft another item necessary to unlock the next area. This item will open the door to the stairs when you return to the corridor.

Stairs and Lobby: Descend the stairs to directly enter the lobby, where you will face a boss. Defeat the boss to obtain the "building_key", which you can use to finish the game.

Good luck and enjoy the game!
